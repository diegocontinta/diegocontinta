Hi, I'm Diego! I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in backend development, data processing, and AI integrations. I enjoy creating efficient, maintainable, and scalable solutions. When I'm not coding, I love learning about emerging tech, contributing to open-source projects, and improving my skills in cloud computing and machine learning.
